# instagram-offline [![Python package][version]][pypi] [![REUSE status][reuse]][reuse-info] [![Vibe coded][badge]][contributing]

Downloads all posts, photos as well as videos and reels, of one or more Instagram accounts and
builds a self-contained static site in `site/`, one folder per account. Watch the creators you
chose distraction-free, without ads, autoplay or an algorithmic feed. Keep a usable archive of
your own work, which Meta's data export does not easily provide.

## How it works

Instagram rejects scripted API clients (Instaloader, gallery-dl, yt-dlp) while a real browser
session works fine. The downloader therefore drives a logged-in Chromium-based browser over the
DevTools protocol: it scrolls the profile grid, harvests the post data Instagram sends to the
page, and downloads the files from Instagram's CDN. Collaboration posts owned by another account
are included. Re-runs only fetch new posts.

## Usage

```sh
uvx instagram-offline USERNAME
python -m http.server -d site
```

`uvx instagram-offline --all` updates every account already archived in `site/`.
From a checkout, you can use `uv run insta` to execute the setup the same way.

Log in to Instagram in the browser window on the first run.

Any Chromium-based browser works: Chromium, Chrome, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi or Opera are found
automatically on Linux, macOS and Windows; `--browser EXECUTABLE` selects one explicitly, and
a Chromium-based browser in the conventional `$BROWSER` variable is preferred over the search.
Without any, Playwright's own Chromium is downloaded on first use.
**Firefox and Safari are not supported**, as they lack the DevTools protocol the tool relies on.

Every account page has topic filters and an "About" box on the overview: by default the topics
are the hashtags the account uses most, and the About text is the account's own bio, captured
with its name, category, follower count and links. An optional `site/USERNAME/profile.json` with
an `about` text and a list of topics (name plus caption keywords) replaces either. Keywords
match at the start of a word; a trailing space makes a keyword match whole words only.

### Versioning the content

`site/` is ignored by this repository. To track changes of the archive, keep it as a separate,
private Git repository that ignores the video files and versions only the metadata, index and
HTML pages:

```sh
cd site
git init
printf '*.mp4\n*.part\n' > .gitignore
git add .
git commit -m "Add archive"
```

After each download run, commit the changes in `site/`.
